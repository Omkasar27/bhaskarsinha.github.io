        <section class="bio">
            <p>Welcome! I am an economist and Assistant Professor at the <a href="#">Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich</a>. 
               I earned my PhD from Northwestern University (Kellogg) in June 2024. Before graduate school, I worked with the International 
               Growth Centre in Uganda and the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources in Rwanda as an ODI Fellow.
            </p>

            <p>I study topics at the intersection of organizational and development economics. Typically, I examine how production works in practice 
               using surveys and personnel data to formulate hypotheses about how firms and workers make decisions. Whenever possible, I partner 
               with organizations—ranging from firms to non-profits and government agencies—to test these hypotheses empirically.
            </p>

            <p>Currently, my research focuses on the role of knowledge, communication, and coordination in production processes. 
               I am also exploring ways to enhance the effectiveness of development policies that target firm (and farm) productivity, 
               particularly by examining the organization of production and policy implementation. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss research!
